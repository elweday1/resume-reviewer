// Utility functions for PDF text extraction
// Note: In a production app, you'd want to use a proper PDF parsing library
// For now, we'll simulate text extraction

export async function extractTextFromPDF(pdfUrl: string): Promise<string> {
  try {
    // In a real implementation, you would:
    // 1. Fetch the PDF from the URL
    // 2. Use a library like pdf-parse or PDF.js to extract text
    // 3. Return the extracted text

    // For demo purposes, we'll return sample text
    // This should be replaced with actual PDF text extraction
